	    <p>
	     Zhen's love of sketchbooks started long before her studies at Carnegie Mellon University for her Bachelor's of Architecture degree. In many ways, sketchbooks are essential. They provide an easy place to record ideas, make studies, and experiment with new techniques. Sometimes sketchbooks themselves are treated as finished pieces of art. In Zhen's case, she began to collect and use sketchbooks at a very young age, starting at first by stapling many folded letter sized papers together. Her sketchbook collection has now grown to encompass many different types of sketchbooks, including brands such as Moleskines (her personal favorite), Shinola, Fabriano, and Strathmore, as well as hand-pressed paper and black-paper sketchbooks.</p>

	    <h1><a href="http://michaelspowell.net">Michael Powell</a></h1>
	    <p>
	    Having entered my second year enrolled in the School of Architecture at Carnegie Mellon University, I am particularly interested in the details, large or small, that start to create spatial environments and perceptions, and further define what architecture can do. Whether it be through my design work, photography, paper cut art, or exploration of new places, I carry this mindset with me everywhere. Through internships, fellowship programs, and design competitions, I seek to improve my current skill set, broaden my understanding of design theory and implementation, and develop new skills and approaches.</p>
